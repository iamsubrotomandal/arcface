## 🔧 Issue Fixed During Review

### **PReLU Layer Configuration**
**Issue Found:** The IRBlock was using a single PReLU layer for two different tensor shapes:
- After `bn1(x)` with `in_channels`
- After `bn2(conv1(x))` with `out_channels`

**Solution Applied:** Split into separate PReLU layers:
```python
# Before (problematic)
self.prelu = nn.PReLU(out_channels)

# After (fixed)
self.prelu1 = nn.PReLU(in_channels)   # For first activation
self.prelu2 = nn.PReLU(out_channels)  # For second activation
```

**Updated forward method:**
```python
def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    identity = x
    out = self.bn1(x)
    out = self.prelu1(out)  # ← Fixed: Use prelu1 for in_channels
    out = self.conv1(out)
    out = self.bn2(out)
    out = self.prelu2(out)  # ← Fixed: Use prelu2 for out_channels
    out = self.conv2(out)
    # ... rest unchanged
```

## 📊 Test Results

### **All Models Successfully Created:**
- ✅ IResNet-18: 24,105,536 parameters
